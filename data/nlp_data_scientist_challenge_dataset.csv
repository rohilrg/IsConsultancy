There are still many variables that are not known with respect to the tariff, but here are some of my thoughts on the issue. There are very few U.S. solar cell manufacturers.They do not have nearly the capacity that is needed for solar growth in the United States.There's an axiom in physics that also applies to business: When a vacuum is created, it will always be filled.

Our technology will change the world. We are Natcore Technology. We're a solar R&D company. And we are creating technology that promises to make solar energy even more cost-competitive with energy derived from fossil fuels. To reach that goal, we must attain the highest silicon cell efficiencies at the lowest cost. Our technology promises to do both. So we're changing how solar cells are made. We have attracted a team of scientists well known for their achievements in the solar industry. We've established exclusive licenses and/or joint research agreements with Rice University, Fraunhofer ISE and the University of Virginia. We've received 34 patents (with 31 more pending). Natcore is aggressively developing two primary technologies: Low-cost, all-back-contact solar cell structures. Black Silicon cells. We've not only achieved exciting new scientific advances in these technologies, we're also now engaging partners who will help us commercialize them. We plan to generate revenue from these technologies via licensing agreements, royalties and material sales agreements with solar cell manufacturers and equipment producers. And through our Best-of-Breed programwherein we leverage our knowledge to function as a consultant on the design and construction of solar cell and panel fabrication facilities and solar farmswe plan togenerate important revenue to support our R&D efforts.

Since we took ownership of Threemile Canyon Farms in 1999, we've challenged ourselves to question long-standing agricultural practices. ""Business as usual"" really has no meaning at Threemile, because we know that as the population grows and the world changes, we must continuously adopt new and better technologies and operational practices to remain relevant and successful. A safe and rewarding work environment means a happy, satisfied workforce that shares ownership in our philosophy and pride in carrying it forward every day, both at work and in our local communities. Learn More About Our Story Inspired by Sustainability When it comes to controlling pests or improving soil, Threemile Canyon Farms uses the most sustainable, effective techniques, based on experience and research. That means nature-based farming solutions often play as important a role in our operations as the latest advances in high-tech equipment and technologies. Learn More Unmatched Commitment to Quality At Threemile Canyon Farms, our core business values are simple: Treat people, the land, and animals respectfully and with care. We grow conventional and organic crops in an Earth-friendly way, with a focus on reusing and recycling. Our conventional and organic dairies place the animal's health and well-being ahead of everything else. Explore Our Products Caring"

We can create focused screening libraries based on a specific indication or target, and we can screen thousands of novel compounds a year. Using various comprehensive screening modalities, we've identified novel antineoplastic, anti-infective, and immunomodulatory small molecules, and we're advancing the most promising candidates identified to date. Agriculture Our platform can be used to identify the compounds produced by a microbe that may be responsible for the beneficial effects observed in phenotypic screening campaigns, and our analysis can help select microbes for evaluation given a specific target, pathogen, or application. We can potentially identify alternate producers of specific compounds of interest, and we can use genomics and metabolomics to find derivatives of known high-value compounds. Food and Nutrition Because we can identify both novel and known compounds produced by microbes, our platform can help define the underlying mechanisms responsible for beneficial health effects observed with probiotics or live microbial therapeutics. We can also identify novel food ingredients, such as flavour enhancers, bitter blockers, or natural preservatives, produced by microbes.

Historically, advances in wastewater collection, treatment and disposal reduced the presence of disease in the general public.

While the traditional methods have worked well and continue to work well in densely populated areas, advances in technology and innovative ideas are allowing for a technological shift in wastewater management. This shift has been driven by many factors including serving an increasing population, development occurring at greater distances from the centralized systems, and tighter regulatory restrictions on the direct discharge of treated effluent.

Ledge Top Farm is located in Wilton, New Hampshire and has been growing vegetables starting 1978. Most produce is sold at local farmers markets, at the farm, and a few restaurants. All of our produce is grown on the farm and some leased locations. Actual growing space on this farm is just over one half acre, but growing thousands in produce. We use no artificial chemicals, herbicides, or pesticides on our produce, instead there is a wide use of beneficial organisms such as microbes, and insects to control any pest. Organic practices have been in place for so long that many pest problems are taken care of by natural predation. We control fertility of the soil with compost and natural amendments like alfalfa meal, feather meal, and kelp meal. Succession planting keeps every soil bed in production. Hand tools are used to cultivate and harvest and tilling is reduced to mixing the top 2 inches of soil. Five greenhouses are used to extend the season and provide early harvests. Keeping the natural microbial life in the soil by not turning soil over is the best plan for sustained organic production. Questions about specific practices can be answered at any time. Tours of the farm and our techniques can be arranged. No artificial chemical pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides No artificial chemical fertilizers No GMO seeds All organic standards followed See Available Produce Where are we?

Through project monitoring, agency partnerships, and coalition building with diverse stakeholders, our work impacts not just individual sites, but the wider watershed as well as environmental policy. Headwaters Initiative Program Just as a river's journey begins with a source, a headwater, so too does our own. Where that journey leads depends on an interwoven connectedness of a healthy natural system. The Headwaters Initiative is committed to exploring and aiding those connections for a healthy and resilient future for all. The Headwaters InitiativePartnership (HIP!) is a unique program for young adults interested in hands-on experience and training in watershed resiliency work and who seek a deeper understanding of themselves and their connection to the natural world.

Scroll Down GROW NEW ANEWWAY TO SUPPORT FARMERS ANEWWAY TO PROTECT THEPLANET ANEWWAY TO FEED THEWORLD OUR MISSION Take action Change the game Break boundaries Make an impact Set new standards The need for urgent action in global agriculture has never been more compelling. Not only can we do better, but the time has come when we simply must. The lack of innovation in agriculture over the last 30 years has left growers around the world to tackle today's challenges with yesterday's solutions. Until now. The idea was simple: apply proven drug discovery and development approaches from the pharmaceutical industry to agriculture. The results have been exceptional. When farmers have a more effective product, they can use less of it. That means easier application and benefits both for people and the planet. Enko's pioneering approach aims to bring effective, earth-friendly solutions for crop production to farmers everywhere. We intend to set new industry standards in safety, sustainability and environmental impact. OUR PLATFORM DNA-Encoded Libraries (DEL) Vast new molecular space Tapping vast new molecular space through efficient screening of billions of molecules. DNA Encoded Libraries (DELs) are changing the way the pharmaceutical industry approaches compound discovery and Enko is among the first to bring the approach to the agriculture industry. By using DELs, we can screen 100's of billions of compounds against each of our targets very cost effectively. Using DELs to identify molecules that act on proteins of interest from target organisms and do not act on the equivalent proteins from non-target organisms (e.g., humans and beneficial organisms) yields an unprecedented number of effective and selective molecules which are high value starting points for developing safe and effective products. DNA-Encoded Libraries (DEL) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Proprietary predictive analytics Leveraging automation and proprietary predictive analytics to streamline decision-making. Finding molecules that are potent, specific, safe, and which have the other characteristics of a successful crop production product is a complex challenge. Enko's proprietary datasets fuel an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that improves our capabilities and accelerates our research by rapidly putting results into the hands of researchers and allowing them to seamlessly incorporate the data"

Bradford Macy, RN, BSN, CHPN Co-founder and President At Hospi, our patient-centric philosophy is built around nursing principles; our products are not designed to cure or to diagnose disease. Instead, they are designed to assist with improving patients' responses to illnesses by alleviating suffering, preventing complications or injury, decreasing the burden of illness for both patients and caregivers, and supporting an environment of respect and dignity. Our products assist clinicians improve quality of life for both patients and their caregivers. ""Hospi understands the needs of patients living with serious or terminal illness and the caregivers who treat them."" Richard Popp, M.D. Co-founder Every patient and family has their own story and a unique journey. Hospi's first product, the Macy Catheter, has enabled clinicians to partner with thousands of patients and their families to identify patients' comfort goals and to help facilitate achievement of those goals while focusing on maximizing quality of life. ""The developed world could go bankrupt if it is not able to control healthcare costs, especially given demographic trends. At Hospi, we believe that the best place to improve healthcare in a sustainable manner is at the patient's bedside. If a nurse can more optimally 'put the patient in the best condition,' to paraphrase Florence Nightingale, cost reductions ensue. Practical, high quality, patient-centric care simply costs less.""

Tim came out to see myself, Dave & my father in April 2014 to discuss some programs that were of interest. After our conversation we decided to engage Ag-Plus to do half the farm for the coming season. At that time our oldest trees were 8 years old. We were determined to have high yields and good quality while improving soil & tree health. Due to the tree health and yield increase on the Ag-Plus program we changed over fully in the 2016 season.

Tim came out to see me about my feedback on the Multikraft products which he was looking at distributing. During this time Tim went through the programs that he had developed that we could incorporate into our farming operation. I decided to get Ag-Plus to do programs for my farm that we still use today.

Contact Us About Us Clinical Decision Support Software Medostic develops proprietary integrated inpatient clinical decision support software to personalize metabolic treatment of critical care patients with the mission of improving glycemic control, inflammation, nutrition and other indications for use common during the acute phase of illness and injury. Biosensor Metabolomic Monitoring Medostic combines measurements of glucose, lactate and other metabolites of the Body Energy State with proprietary algorithms to prescribe personalized infusion administration of formulations and therapeutics for critical care patients. Formulations and Therapeutics Medostic proprietary formulations and therapeutics will be indicated for use for metabolic and nutritional needs including glycemic control and other indications for use of critical care patients and are currently in clinical trials. Background Lactate Shuttle Changed Science / Changed Medicine Based on Lactate Shuttle theory discovered by Medostic cofounder Professor George A. Brooks at UC Berkeley, the role of lactate has at least three main uses in the body: It's a major fuel source, it's the major material to support blood sugar (glucose) level and it's a powerful signal for metabolic adaptation to stress. Lactate supplementation therapy has been shown in clinical trials to improve outcomes in critical care patients with stress hyperglycemia, inflammation (e.g. traumatic brain injury, acute pancreatitis), nutritional needs and other indications for use that are typical during the acute phase of illness and injury. Journal Reference : George A. Brooks. The Science and Translation of Lactate Shuttle Theory .

Everyday practice shows that personal doctor-patient contact is necessary in only about 50% of all treatments.

Do not require pesticide Deliver strong and robust plants Need less energy, water and fertilizer... Are sustainable, environmentally friendly and safe At Blomitec we make this dream reality. We unleash the beneficial power of natural microorganisms that live in and outside the plant, designing robust crops that grow with a minimal input of chemicals and energy. Plant & Microbes : Partners in yield. Forever. Plant are naturally full of probiotic bacteria and fungi that nurture the plant and shield it against diseases and stress. Together, plant-associated microorganisms are called the microbiome. Even if it is invisible, the microbiome is an integral part of the plant. It is often called the plant's ""second genome"": Only half of the plant's genes are found in its own genome. The rest is hidden in microorganisms, which provide all the plant needs to be strong and productive. Microbiome deterioration and the loss of crop quality: Breeding and cultivation practices have improved the plant genetic material but let the microbiome deteriorate. As a result, probiotic microbes are suppressed by parasitic ones. This is a serious issue for your yield, as without probiotic microbes plants lose their ability to respond to stress. This results in high mortality, irregular plant growth and poor overall quality. At Blomitec, we restore plant quality by grooming the microbiome, thereby allowing probiotic microorganisms to strive and restore plant quality. Microbiome Improvement The importance of microorganisms for plant growth is known for decades, but it has remained virtually impossible to reliably steer the natural plant microbiome to obtain desired plant traits. Blossom's proprietary Microbiome Improvement Technology solves this issue. We have developed targeted interventions that cleans the microbiomes from parasitic organisms, rescuing and stimulating the beneficial ones and ensuring robust plants and reliable yields. We use state-of-the art DNA-based technology combined with a specially developed artificial intelligence algorithm to identify and stimulate the probiotic microorganisms naturally contributing to robust plant growth. Our technology is 100% organic, GMO-free, and compatible with existing production systems. Benefits of microbiome improvement Our microbiome improvement technology offers a fast, targeted and effective plant enhancement. Our services are available along the whole value chain including: Breeding We Compensate traits lost during phenotype selection Multiplication"

To remedy this, the global water community will be speaking with one voice at the upcoming UNFCCC COP 26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow and host a joint Water Pavilion.

Yet only 1% of its surface area is actually freshwater.

These natural water services perform an infrastructure-like function and are part of what is termed 'Nature-based Solutions'.

Product Maintenance Optimized Catch Basins for Verified Stormwater Treatment. SiltPrison systems are a new take on existing precast stormwater collection structures. Our unique catch basin risers are manufactured with inverted cone filtration membranes which actually encapsulate stormwater for pressurized removal of fine sediment and phosphorus. Seeking Solutions? The SiltPrison is a stormwater quality unit that provides new solutions to the evolving needs and regulations in civil site design. Product Information 1 2 3 Schedule a Lunch and Learn: By seeking out Specifiers, Peer Reviewers, and Town Engineers alike we hope to join the conversation of effective modes of stormwater treatment. Schedule a Date Verification Testing The SiltPrison has undergone testing and review at Alden Laboratories and by the Massachusetts BMP Clearinghouse, MASTEP. The SiltPrison's treatment mechanism of filtration and settling were evaluated and tested at Alden for three different performance characteristics: re-entrainment, hydraulic characteristics, and sediment removal efficiency. Among the findings were a 62% sediment removal rating and impressive performance of the SiltPrison to prevent re-entrainment and washout. The mission of the MASTEP program was to provide technology transfer information about innovative stormwater Best Management Practices to MADEP, conservation commissions, local officials, and other BMP users to help them make appropriate technology implementation decisions. In essence, they evaluate the quality of a stormwater product's performance claims based on supporting information and testing data. The SiltPrison was rated 2 on their 1-4 Scale stating ""sound laboratory studies exist for this product"". The SiltPrison was the last stormwater treatment technology reviewed by MASTEP, and the only unit ever to be categorized as an Advanced Inlet Device, ushering in a new generation of stormwater treatment technique, which is currently unmatched. The SBZ SiltPrison profile by MASTEP can be found here.

Sådan hjælper vi dig Sådan hjælper vi hinanden Sådan hjælper vi samfundet Har du brug for spildevandsrensning til et hus eller en hel landsby? Beplantet filteranlæg, spildevandsrensning, minirensningsanlæg & nedsivningsanlæg Et beplantet filteranlæg klarer alt dit spildevand. Uanset anlægsstørrelse og spildevandskvalitet kan Kilian Water ApS være din samarbejdspartner lige fra de første overvejelser til design og etablering. Ring til os på 75 75 79 01 eller brug kontaktformularen Bæredygtig spildevandsrensning gennem 25 år Kilian Water har 25 års erfaring i grøn spildevandsrensning. Siden det første anlæg blev bygget, har vi løbende forsket og udviklet, så vi nu står med et helt udvalg af gode designs, der kan opfylde ethvert behov for spildevandsrensning. Vi har et tæt samarbejde med universiteter, både nationalt og internationalt, for at sikre at vi kan tilbyde veldokumenteret rensning af spildevand i det åbne land. Vi står bag over 900 beplantede filteranlæg i Danmark- anlæg i alle størrelser, helt op til 400 personer. Hvad er et beplantet filteranlæg egentlig for noget? Det er et ""naturligt"" anlæg hvor der er indtænkt alle de praktiske behov, du som husejer har, i forhold til at kunne rense dit spildevand selv: Pladsforhold, svingende spildevandsmængder, lavt strømforbrug, lille vedligeholdelsesbehov, jordtype, grundvandsforhold og afstandskrav. Alle forhold er indtænkt på en måde, så vi kan tilbyde dig den mest optimale løsning. Kvalitet, miljø og økonomi går hånd i hånd når du vælger et beplantet filteranlæg.. Anlægget er lavteknologisk, hvilket betyder at der er få tekniske dele i anlægget, der kan gå i stykker og give driftsproblemer. Det beplantede filter er designet så de naturlige processer får bedst mulige ""arbejdsvilkår"" til at rense spildevandet. Det giver et lavt strømforbrug. Der er således god sammenhæng mellem lavt ressourceforbrug, lang levetid på anlægget- og god økonomi. Udforsk"

Therefore, we develop personalized innovative health-tracking platforms based on latest scientific knowledge and technologies. Our platforms combine innovative in-vitro diagnostic test devices for home use with smart digital technologies and intelligent algorithms. Change How we deal with our health is undergoing a substantial change. The increasing health awareness especially of female individuals is boosting the demand for tools that provide us with information about our health. The industry already offers a significant number of smart tools but restricted to lifestyle rather than health in a medical sense. Contribution We develop devices that allow the diagnostic testing of menstrual blood, vaginal fluids and cells and the smart analysis of these health data for self-testing at home as easy as measuring the body temperature. The result will be a platform that provides the female individual personalized information about the development of their health. MULIER HEALTH SELF-TEST Measuring health Technologies such as new sensors, smart devices and applications have enabled individuals to monitor their health and fitness. These new technologies are currently limited to physiological and fitness-related parameters, such as blood pressure, heartbeat, temperature or step-count data. However, blood-based parameters are the most sensitive and most reliable parameters to monitor health. Yet blood-based parameters have not been accessible for these new technologies in particular for self-testing at home. With new technologies We bring these technologies together to give the woman the opportunity to monitor their health development. We integrate in-vitro diagnostic tests to collect individual data and perform diagnoses with smart data analysis and links to scientific knowledge from medical data-bases into small intuitive to use devices for home use. As a result the female individual is getting an interpretation of the deviation from the healthy personal pathway. The deviation will trigger an alert that can be extended to a personalized clinical advice. Easy to use The diagnostic devices allow female individuals to run blood-based and cell-based diagnostic tests without pain and without the need of specific training. An app will enable to control the device, to interpret the test results, to create electronic diaries and alerts and optionally to"

What we've been up to EpiEP, Inc. is a medical device company that has developed an FDA cleared and CE marked epicardial access system, EpiAccess. This system engages a patent protected pressure-guided needle that is designed to alert physicians of needle tip location during epicardial access procedures. Entering the pericardial space with a minimally invasive technique is considered the ""final frontier"" for electrophysiology procedures. EpiEP has devoted itself to developing a specialized instrument that will facilitate an epicardial approach for patients who will benefit from minimally invasive procedures on the surface of the heart. Watch Video DOWNLOAD PRODUCT BROCHURE Our Mission An epicardial approach allows the physician to work on the outside surface of the heart muscle rather than on the inside of the heart. While several companies have emerged with epicardial tools for treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT), atrial fibrillation (AF), and left atrial appendage (LAA) ligation, EpiEP's solution uniquely employs a pressure guided needle in conjunction with standard of care fluoroscopy to provide the physician with safe, precise, real-time guidance confirming access into the pericardial cavity. During pre-clinical and clinical trials, physicians have expressed satisfaction with the performance of the EpiAccess System and its unique ability to display adjunctive data, designed to permit the physician to recognize when the needle tip reaches the pericardial space. This is a technology platform that can be calibrated for other anatomic locations within the body, but to date our focus has been the development and commercialization of the EpiAccess System to provide pressure guided access to the pericardial space.

In fact, 1 in 17 of us will be affected by a rare disease in our lifetime. This is comparable to common diseases such as diabetes and asthma. Often misdiagnosed Rare disease symptoms often develop gradually and in different organ systems. This means patients present to different doctors for seemingly independent reasons making these diseases difficult to diagnose. Patients endure avoidable complications On average, rare disease patients experience 3 misdiagnoses, visit 5 different doctors and wait over 4 years before receiving a diagnosis in the UK. Rare diseases are expensive Our commissioned health economics report found that undiagnosed rare diseases have cost the NHS in excess of 3.4 billion in the past decade. MendelScan brings early disease identification to healthcare providers Find out how it works CASE STUDY Behcet's disease In a retrospective study, MendelScan highlighted fourteen patients with clinical features of Bechet's disease, only two of which had received a diagnosis through traditional methods.

Using our proprietary microfluidic robotics, more cardiologists can safely and cost-effectively treat the large number of patients who need mitral valve clip therapies. Extending the Benefits of Heart Repair Heart mitral valve repair has not reached the masses. Open-heart surgery, the historical standard of care, is highly invasive and too risky for the vast majority who would benefit. Transcatheter mitral valve procedures, with access through the veins, are minimally invasive, but are difficult to perform. However, low trauma therapy works! The Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER), or clip therapy, is rapidly becoming the new standard of care. The 2018 COAPT trial shows that percutaneous interventions (with access through blood vessels) can be equally successful and is much less traumatic than open-heart surgery. Unfortunately, the complexity of the current mechanical instrumentation requires a long learning curve that prohibits mass adoption. A consequence only 2% of sufferers are treated and there are millions of new patients each year. The Coral System in action Empowering Cardiologists Moray Medical is simplifying the percutaneous delivery of valve therapies for interventional cardiologists of all skill levels. Millions of patients will benefit from this cost-effective and easy-to-learn-and-use delivery system. A larger and more dispersed group of interventionalists will be able to successfully treat patients with leaking heart valves. Today, when placing a valve clip, the delivery system is not intuitive. The mitral valve edge-to-edge procedure typically requires four hands and two highly skilled interventional doctors. Even the most elite teams are challenged. Implanting clips is time-consuming, expensive, and is generally performed in a few specialized urban centers. Moray's robotic system, with its digital user interface, enables a single hand to control the placement of a clip. Powered by microfluidics, the catheter system is fast, precise, and intuitive; yet comparable in size to existing manual systems, and costs less to manufacture. Market The structural heart market is one of the fastest growing medical-device fields. The market's growth has accelerated with the rise of the Transcatheter Mitral Valve repair (TMVr) treatments, and more specifically Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER), which is already a multibillion-dollar market.

For water, it's Now or Never! The Swiss Solution to a Global Problem. We protect our precious water resources, humans, and our environment from the negative impacts of highly persistent, mobile and toxic micropollutants with our efficient and sustainable technology. From efficient water treatment to advanced monitoring We are the micropollutant experts. As seen in As seen in What Micropollutants represent a massive range of organic pollutants that are released from products used by all of us daily. Pharmaceuticals, hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, personal care products, industrial chemicals, forever chemicals or PFAS, etc. These persistent compounds are non-biodegradable, bio-active, carcinogenic, and toxic to the lives of humans and our ecosystems. They pose significant risks even at very low concentrations such as 1 ng/L, hence, they are termed micropollutants. A wide range of problematic micropollutants have already been detected in rivers, lakes, groundwater, drinking water, and even our rainwater, Globally! But: Thanks to our unique technology, we can remove a large proportion of the micropollutants from wastewater and thus provide a cleaner environment cost-effectively and sustainably. Read more <p class='p1'>When micropollutants have been released into our environment (such as rivers, groundwater, soil) without receiving proper treatment, they continue to accumulate and increase in concentration. This negatively impacts the health of humans, aquatic organisms, animals, and other ecosystems that rely on our natural resources for survival.</p><p><strong>Oxyle's scalable wastewater treatment technology efficiently removes micropollutants (even when present in low concentrations) from contaminated groundwater and soil washing wastewater.</strong></p><p> </p><p class='p1'>Wastewater from production of pharmaceuticals contains hundreds of micropollutants such as antibiotics, antidepressants, hormones, antihistamines etc in very high concentrations.

The resistance entails that the pre-harvest use of fungicides is reduced, and crops are not contaminated, pre- or post-harvest, with fungal toxins that are hazardous to animals and humans. OUR SOLUTION Our crops obtain fungal resistance by enhanced Nepenthesin Expression (ENE). Nepenthesin is a naturally occurring protease first identified in the pitcher secretions of plants of the Nepenthes genus, a group of carnivorous plants. The resistance mechanism is non-cytotoxic but works through inhibition of fungal activity of phytase, an enzyme essential for releasing phosphate required for fungal growth. The result is starvation of the fungus and therefore reduced growth and toxin production. As the inhibition mechanism involves multiple interactions between the inhibitor and the enzyme, the risk of rapid development of fungal resistance is considered very low.

This untreated wastewater is polluting our environment, contaminating our water resources, and damaging our aquatic life. If we treat and recycle, this amount of sewage could be a resource of water enough to meet 25% of the global domestic water demand. The centralized wastewater treatment approach is adopted in the urban area of Saudi Arabia. However, only 60% of the area covered by the existing wastewater network in Saudi Arabia. The development is very scattered, and it's not economically viable to provide wastewater networks everywhere. Therefore, wastewater transported from the unserved areas via trucks to centralize treatment plant for treatment and disposal, as we get farther from the centralized plant, the wastewater transportation cost increases. The current centralized treatment technology in the kingdom is design to the only treatment of the wastewater not to recycle wastewater. The solution to these problems is to have decentralized water recycling systems for onsite wastewater recycling without transportation. Al-Miyah has developed a novel decentralized water recycling technology. Our technology is compact (25% less area required), and it can save 80% energy and requires less maintenance. Our system can be mounted on a shipping container, and it's movable, plug and play, modular and scalable and robust. Our technology produces reliable quality recycled water suitable for many non-potable applications such as landscaping, horticulture, toilet flushing, floor washing, etc. Share Your Vision Say More About Your Website Powered by Squarespace"

Learn More Our Vision We are part of an agricultural revolution. We think hemp is potentially the world's most versatile crop in the history of agriculture. It is a genus of flowering plants that include the species sativa, indica, and ruderalis. Scientifically this includes all forms of hemp: low-THC, a high-THC content under regulation, or any hemp with variations of major and minor cannabinoids. From a scientific perspective, they are all the same plant producing different ingredients that can be harvested for a wide variety of industries and uses depending on local and national regulations. Wellness In addition to the phytocannabinoids, hemp is full of other compounds that are known as superfoods or relevant to human wellness. Nutritional Hemp seed is an incredible plant-based protein source, providing more good omega fatty acids and the same amino acids as beef or lamb. Medical Phytocannabinoids interact with the human Endocannabinoid System (ECS). The ECS helps keep many, if not all, human biological systems in balance, which in turn helps control disease. Industrial Hemp biomass can be converted into materials used in: Energy, Technology, Construction, Textiles, Plastics, and Paper. There's a lot of good growth on these plants they're ready to go. They just look like they're ready to jump in the soil and do their thing. Michael Bankston Coastal Alabama Organix Next Really, having that perfectly shaped root system and the fact"

Yet, today's green pest-control solutions present several serious drawbacks. First and foremost, today's green solutions are only effective for relatively short periods of time (compared with chemical solutions). Also, most green solutions entail high labor costs, and many of them require complex application methods. Agrorim's innovation offers an alternative that is highly effective over a significantly longer period of time, requires low labor costs and utilizes simple application methods. Applications & Solutions Pheromones Insect repellents Post-harvest Bio-stimulants Living organisms secrete pheromones to help them communicate. Different pheromones have different functions: Sounding an alarm, creating food trails, calling for aggregation, attracting the opposite sex, and more. One pest-control strategy uses insects' sex pheromones to inhibit mating, preventing female fertilization and laying of eggs that will eventually hatch to harm the crops. Two mechanisms exist for pest-control by pheromones: Mass trapping , where the sex pheromone of a female insect is released from a dispenser to attract, capture and kill the males. Mating disruption , where the female insects' sex pheromones are released throughout the crop to disrupt the males' ability to locate them. The pheromone-based pesticides available today have short-term bioactivity. Their application is complex and requires high-cost labor. Agrorim's delivery platform creates green, pheromone-based pesticides with significant advantages: Long-lasting effectiveness, ease of use and low labor costs. Using the mating disruption method, only one field application at the start of the season protects a crop from the target insect for the entire season. "" Pheromat"" is currently under development for the mass trapping of olive pests (olive fruit fly, olive moth and jasmine moth) and as well as for other pests (codling moth, false codling moth and tuta absoluta moth). In nature,there areplants release volatile substances to repel insects. Situating"

a4f65ec400e479a0a5407dcfbb147f88,414,0,0.0,"Lucrative Investment in MedTech Vascular Closure System for Large Bore Access 8x return of investment* Exit after FDA approval in 2.5 years* Last investment opportunity before FDA approval Key opinion leaders (cardiologists and surgeons) amongst the first investors * based upon expectations on exit and valuation LEARN MORE Request Documents Request Documents PROBLEM Medical Need Interventions via the femoral vein for minimally invasive cardiovascular therapies are already very common and will continue to increase in the future. These therapies include leadless pacemaker, mitral and tricuspid valve replacement, and ECMO (among many others). Additionally, many other complex repair systems of mitral valve or tricuspid valves, for example, are currently in clinical trials. Such therapies require punctures (access holes in the vessel wall) of more than one centimeter. While these novel therapies provide a positive therapeutic impact for the patient, the open hole in the vessel wall remains a considerable problem after the actual intervention has been completed. In 95% of venous catheter interventions, bleeding is currently stopped by manual compression. This process starts with an assistant applying manual pressure (thumb, palm, ball of the hand) for about 30 minutes. Subsequently, the patient is bedridden for about 5 to 6 hours with a compression bandage or sandbag pressing on their thigh. This does not only cause painful discomfort for the patient but also extensive hematoma and prolong immobility. In addition, bleeding complications from compression cannot be ruled out. This process is time consuming, thus expensive, ties up staff, leads to longer bed occupancy times delaying discharge. Every minute that can be reduced from the patient's recovery time will save the hospital $17 and studies have shown that on average $3689 can be saved by quicker patient discharge. Venock will save up to 6 hours in recovery time during which the patient would otherwise spend in the hospital after manual compression. Currently, there are only a few venous closure systems on the market, which are very limited in their applications and are therefore hardly used. These closure systems can only be used on small holes in veins (2-3 mm dia). They are unsuitable for interventions for larger punctures (holes). SOLUTION Venock Closure Device How does it work? Venock has developed a closure system which allows the cardiologist to close a large puncture in the vein wall"

During this process, the extracted data is digitised and put in a structured format so it can move more effectively down the Data Value Chain. We can also enrich this data by using external sources and domain knowledge for further validation. Data Management Data is made more useful and accessible when stored and organised with metadata.

Direct them through the Rapid Radicals system and safely back into lakes and rivers without overflows or backups. Product & Benefits Partners & Mentors Operators Rapid Radicals system operators become members of the Rapid Radicals team through the system commissioning process and O&M training. Product & Benefits Partners & Mentors How It Works for Wet Weather Applications Sanitary and/or combined sewer overflow wastewater is directed to the Rapid Radicals system during a storm event. The wastewater enters a process for rapid primary treatment to remove solids, soluble organic strength, and nutrients. Clarified water then passes into a chemical oxidation contact chamber to disinfect pathogens, remove soluble organic strength, and oxidize micropollutants. Hydroxyl radicals are made en masse for rapid treatment. Residual oxidant is removed from the Rapid Radicals system effluent to introduce balanced water into the river and lake ecosystem. Clean water is then safely released into the receiving waters. Learn More About Rapid Radicals Rapid Radicals Technology, LLC is commercializing an innovative high-rate wastewater treatment technology, originally developed to address combined sewer overflows and achieve rapid stormwater management for municipal sewerage districts. Our technology reduces the eight hours it currently takes a treatment plant to treat wastewater down to 25 minutes. This innovative breakthrough in rapid, advanced-performance wastewater treatment is achieved in a small footprint and cost-effectively achieves treatment outcomes, making it an application not only for wet weather but also providing additional treatment capacity for municipalities and industrial wastewater treatment.

LEARN MORE Our Science KeifeRx seeks to leverage mechanisms of action inherent to TKIs which thus far have been underexplored: the ability to penetrate the brain, induce autophagy, and enable the bulk disposal of disease-causing toxic proteins to treat neurodegenerative diseases, and the ability to target mast cells and simultaneously modulate peripheral and central immunity, providing therapeutic potential for an array of immune diseases. These properties offer the potential to significantly improve upon current neurodegenerative and immune disease treatments, which are primarily palliative and offer minimal and temporary benefits due to their inability to adequately eliminate toxic proteins and mitigate inflammation. LEARN MORE Our Pipeline KeifeRx is currently investigating or plans to investigate its TKI formulations in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and movement disorders, including Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease. Additionally, KeifeRx is advancing novel TKIs targeting inflammatory diseases, including mast cell activated syndromes (MCAS), Lyme disease, and Urticaria, as well as neuro-inflammatory conditions that are features of neurodegeneration.

The challenge As farmers strive to meet a rising population's demand to grow more food with less environmental impact, they face many challenges - including the rapid rise of herbicide resistant weeds. To keep growing food sustainably, we need better herbicides used in better ways. Without them, growers could easily lose half their yields and would be forced to abandon regenerative practices like low and no till. Our farmlands would produce less and the food we eat would require more water, fertilizer, and area to grow it. As a result, we'd see increased water stress, fertilizer use, erosion, deforestation and CO2 emissions worldwide. Novel modes of action Herbicides with new modes of action (MOAs) can break resistance and improve safety and sustainability. Today weed resistance affects more than 250 weed species infesting nearly 100 crops. As a result, weed management costs have doubled for many farmers, and we're overusing a dwindling number of herbicides at ever higher rates. The root of the problem is the difficulty in finding new MOAs - none have been introduced in the past 30 years. As regulators withdraw older, less effective herbicides, even more pressure is put on the options that remain. We can do better. We need herbicides with new modes of action that work together with other innovative tools and techniques so we can keep our crops safe. * A mode of action is a specific way in which chemistry interacts with plant biology to inhibit the growth of weeds. Our approach moa will discover a new generation of safer herbicides, countering"

Scientific Studies Conclude: The microbial mixture in Rhizol significantly increases plant and soil health. Impact of Long-term Fertilizer and Pesticide Use "" Between 1955 and 1973 global crop yields increased significantly as hundreds of toxic chemical pesticides and fertilizers became available. Since then, yields per acre have dramatically decreased due to soil degradation the chemicals have caused, while widespread chemical use has resulted in chronic human disease and ecological degradation "" --Dr. Robert Bruck, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, NCSU and ProGro BIO Inc. Chief Science Officer 01 Negatively Impacts Health Chemical pesticides can poison the food supply. Exposure can cause fertility and reproductive issues, diabetes, obesity, and degenerative diseases. 02 Harmful to Expectant Mothers & Children Exposure is linked to childhood cancers, neurodevelopmental disorders, disruption to endocrine systems, and other disorders. 03 Drains Economies Pesticide exposure-related illness creates lost workdays. Exploitative markets lead to farmer dependency and overuse. The cost to use is growing while effectiveness is being diminished. 04 Decreases Biodiversity Pesticides have been linked to declines in pollinators, beneficial insects, birds, mammals, aquatic animals, and non-target plants. 05 Damages Water, Soil, and Air Run-off contaminates surface and groundwater.

At the Toothpick Project, we have created a biological solution to this biological problem. By selectinglocal fungal strains that produce unusually high amounts of specific amino acids, we were able to find an alternative solution to fighting Striga . This fungal strain specifically attacks the weed, rather than the crop, allowing striga-infested fields to increase their crop yield by 42-56%. STRIGA: THE BIGGEST THREAT TO FOOD SECURITY LEARN MORE WHEN STRIGA HITS, IT DEVASTATES CROPS... Our History John Porter Sands, Jr. realized malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa could only be improved once food security increased. Our Technology Researched at Montana State University, specific fungal strains can target striga without harming the crop. The Farmers There are 40 million smallholder farmers who have striga ontheir fields, yet do not have access to solutions. The Impact Increased crop yields improve nutrition, reduce risk of illness, and provide additional income to pay for education.

As a result, clinicians rely on subjective scales to measure efficacy of treatment which typically result in increased costs, poor patient outcomes, and years of time spent trying to find the right treatment. Increased Costs while outcomes stagnant A recent study showed that in the USA, direct costs related to Epilepsy have almost doubled in the last decade to $28B per year , while outcomes have not improved in almost three decades . The Parents' Perspective For Patients, it is even more difficult to be the 'eyes' of the clinicians outside of the clinic, particularly in trying to keep track of disease progression given the lack of knowledge of what to look for and if they are doing it well. Hear the perspective of Amy and David - parents of a child diagnosed with epilepsy. The solution Eysz is building a passive neurological exam using real world data. By leveraging oculometric data from consumer grade eye-tracking systems, our software algorithms have the potential to reliably detect consciousness and other neurological 'vital signs' such as cognition and mood. While our initial focus will be Epilepsy, our aim is to expand to other neurological disorders. The Potential Benefits Improving Outcomes Improving Quality of Life Improving Quality of Life By helping clinicians get the data they need to identify the right treatments sooner. Improving Quality of Life Improving Quality of Life Improving Quality of Life Relieving patients and caregivers from the burden of self-reporting.

Veolia commissioned the one-of-a-kind survey as part of its global effort to measure world sentiment around climate disruption and the public acceptance of solutions. The results are clear: people recognize that climate change is a reality and the effects of climate change are serious and getting worse. A majority of them believe doing nothing will cost more in the long run. Though most respondents in the Veolia survey don't believe there has been enough public discussion of climate change solutions, a majority of the world and a majority of Americans is optimistic that humankind is capable of mitigating its effects, if we start now.

These strategies explore the potential for new models of care based on digital technology, including mobile apps , consumer health devices and wearables, digital health communities , consumer genomics, precision medicine, Patient Reported Outcomes, gamification , etc. Whilst traditional eHealth strategies focus on driving supply-side efficiencies in healthcare, Digital Health Strategies extend this to include demand-side levers . Through the power of digital technologies and mobile devices, health organisations now have the ability to reach into the pocket of health consumers, changing behaviours and activating both the patient and their carers. Digital Health Innovation We work with some of the leading Digital Health innovators across Australia, the United States and Canada, providing Digital Health solutions and developing these tools into genuinely new models of care. Of particular interest are: Patient Reported Outcomes Using Patient Reported Outcome measures to monitor the clinical risk of remote patients, allowing early intervention, the activation of the carer network, the use of Clinical Decision Support and risk-based usage of health system resources Gamification Harnessing the power of intrinsic (i.e. things that come from within such as competitiveness, pride, etc.) and extrinsic (i.e. external reward) motivators to change patient behaviours and reduce the risk of future disease Consumer Genomics and Precision Medicine Using low cost consumer genome sequencing technology to improve the efficiency of medication prescribing and the accuracy of diagnosis Engaged Patient and Carer Advocacy We are passionate advocates of engaged patients and carers, and believe that both have a large role to play in the redesign of the health system to meet the needs of health consumers in the 21 st century. We speak up on behalf of patients and carers, and have spoken openly and honestly at a number of conferences and public forums about our own experiences as patients and carers in the health system . Our speaking and advocacy services can be engaged upon request. Medications Management, Precision Medicine and Pharmacogenomics We have experience in developing the Australian National Electronic Medications Management Strategy, delivering successful electronic prescribing projects, working on Digital"

My Journey How I can help We develop AI solutions tailored to our Client's unique needs and ideas . My Journey How I can help We provide AI R&D as a Service (RDaaS) , combining expertise in Artificial Intelligence with a proven R&D process. Our mission is to develop custom AI solutions to create new competitive advantages and IP for our Clients. Through our AI and R&D expertise, we provide faster time to market and predictable AI developments . WHY AI R&D AS A SERVICE Artificial Intelligence is becoming fundamental to all industries at exponential speed. However, in contrast with other technologies, developing a customized AI system requires a very knowledgeable AI R&D team, which is costly and rarely justified as a permanent company structure. DEEP AI Lab provides an AI capability as a service , developing and realizing AI-based solutions tailored to the client's operational challenges and priorities. Specialized in developing AI solutions, prototypes and proof-of-concept, we support our Clients and partners with shorter development times and more cost-efficient product development. This is AI R&D as a service. HOW WE WORK By deep-diving into your specific industry or domain, we help solve YOUR technical challenges. Leveraging specialized know-how and data we develop the right AI tools able to provide a new competitive advantage or improve your operations. We adopt a Design Thinking approach to immerse into your unique challenges while bringing our Artificial Intelligence and R&D expertise. For instance, to help with challenges faced by an Interventional Cardiologist, we had first to become sufficiently acquainted with the medical processes in the cath lab before effectively layering up our expertise in Computer vision and AI. However, the same techniques we developed to track a guidewire in a fluoroscopy image could also be a good starting point to add AI to a commercial drone to identify and skip dangerous overhead power lines. AI and Design thinking can be applied to any problem in any industry, as long as a sound, predictable AI R&D process is applied. Through our ""R&D as a Service"" projects we deliver cutomized AI solutions to our Clients in 8-12 weeks on average. Contact"

The future of cell therapy ""Harnessing the Power of Mitochondria to Fight Disease"" Research efforts for the last 10 years have been devoted to mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer, which led to evaluating it in neurodegenerative diseases. This resulted in the discovery and development of Mitochondria Organelle Transplantation (MOT ) technology. We have successfully demonstrated proof of concept for this cellular biotherapy which holds great promise for millions suffering from neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. We have exclusive licensing to MOT and there is currently no other therapy available like it.

Our medical device technology offers unparalleled transdermal activation of the homeostatic nuclei of the brainstem and hypothalamus, allowing for alterations in autonomic function, circadian regulation and Neuro-metabolic influence. Our core values hinge on the generation of robust clinical data that provide meaningful outcomes throughout the lives of our patients. Neurovalens technology aims to provide drug-free solutions to the worlds, greatest health epidemics. Merging Neuroscience & Technology Applications for Neurovalens Technology Type 2 Diabetes / Obesity Primary Target: Central Melanocortin System (CMCS) & Arcuate Nucleus (Hypothalamus) Secondary Target: Dorsal Motor Nucleus of Vagus & Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (Brainstem) Our goal in type 2 diabetes is to improve glucose and insulin regulation and therefore positively influence HbA1c. Optimization of the central melanocortin system and regulation of the vagal nerve afferents are the primary target areas to allow better glycemic control and potentially reduce the need for pharmaceuticals. Poor regulation of metabolic homeostasis drives the development of obesity. Neurovalens targets key hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei involved in the neuro-regulation of body composition, with the aim of improving this dysregulation at source. Insomnia Primary Target: Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) (Hypothalamus) Secondary Target: Intergeniculate Leaflet (IGL) (Thalamus) Homeostatic centers within the hypothalamus and thalamus regulate the circadian rhythm the and sleep wake cycle. Neurovalens' technology actively stimulates the SCN and IGL in a way that improves both sleep quality and duration. Anxiety Primary Target: Locus Coeruleus (LC) (Brainstem) Secondary Target: Paraventricular Nucleus (PVN) (Hypothalamus) Regulation of the parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways of the autonomic nervous system in response to stress can be influenced via the LC and the PVN. Connections to these centers via the medial vestibular nucleus allow both to be non-invasively targeted.

All the weeds, grass, and added pests may seem stressful, spring lawn care is the perfect time to start planning ahead for summer, too. Spring lawn care is a great way to maintain your front or backyards, prep your garden, and get ready for more fun under the sun! These tips will help you make changes yourself, but you can also work with a professional lawn care company to give your yard a spring cleaning. After winter, the grass may be in some dire need of TLC, so working with professionals can help revitalize a lawn that's been dried out by harsh weather. Tip #1: Start Cleaning Up Any Winter Leftovers After the long winter season, your lawn has likely accumulated a collection of leaves, branches, twigs, and weeds that need to be thrown away. Cleaning up your yard offers ample space to fertilize, hydrate, and restore your grass to its former glory. Tip #2: Prepare to Aerate As grass and soil stays packed under snow, they compress and become difficult to fertilize and replenish. Worst of all, a layer of dead and decaying grass can get trapped between the soil. This material, called thatch, makes it difficult for you to restore a lawn. Aeration is the process of puncturing holes in the soil to allow fresh air, water, and fertilizer into the soil. It's an easy process that can be done by you or a professional. Before you start the process, you should water your lawn every day for at least two days prior. Then, using a lawn aerator tool, cover the lawn in one direction before moving back in a perpendicular motion. Be mindful of any sprinklers during the process. Steel spike aerators are the best for small lawns. If you have a large lawn, then hiring a professional lawn care company is likely a better option. Tip #3: Apply Seeds for Abundant Growth To make sure your lawn looks"

After 20 years, we are proud to be known as: ""the Landscape Architect's irrigation consultant"". Established in 1994, Landtech Design has years of experience in providing solutions on challenging landscape projects. One of Landtech Design's most differentiating features is our desire & willingness to discuss with clients the options available for 'control' (irrigation control) on the site once it is in the hands of the end-user. We believe that the design team and their client should understand the differences in the controller's features, communication methods, and the hand-held remote capabilities since that is the primary user-interface.

Claudin-1 (CLDN1) is a member of the tight junction proteins family. During disease pathogenesis, CLDN1 expression is up-regulated and exposed outside of the tight junction. Exposed, nontight junctional, CLDN1 drives carcinogenic and fibrogenic signaling in different organs. Alentis' lead candidates are monoclonal antibodies that are highly selective for exposed and non-junctional CLDN1. Remodeling and stiffening of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key driver of end-stage organ failure, with downstream fibrotic disorders accounting for up to 45% of deaths in developed countries*. ECM remodeling is also a hallmark of cancer. Despite the urgent medical need, cancer indications characterized by a stiff and nonpermeable ECM and fibrotic diseases are an underserved market and Alentis' pioneering approach has the potential to directly modify and reverse the course of disease progression. Team Led by a highly experienced and entrepreneurial leadership team and a world-class founder with expertise in fibrosis, rare diseases, and cancer, Alentis is driven to bring life-saving treatments to patients with cancers with a stiff, nonpermeable ECM and immune-evasive tumor microenvironment and fibrosis-associated diseases. Alentis is headquartered in Basel's pharma-biotech hub in Switzerland with a subsidiary for R&D in Strasbourg, France. * Wynn TA. Fibrotic disease and the T(H)1/T(H)2 paradigm.
